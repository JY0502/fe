* Decorate Student List

Write a function called decorateClassListWithAges. Convert from an array, in this case a class list of names, to an array of object literals decorated with a name and an age for each student. Your decorateClassListWithAges function should use the provided getRandomIntInclusive as part of its solution. (The ages should be randomly generated for each student, either age 10 or age 11)

The "test suite" that you write for this question will be one of the most complex we have seen so far. In order to verify that your code works as expected, you will need to find a way to iterate over the actual array result of your function, then ensure that the age value for each object in your result is "within the range" of 10 to 11. If you are having tremendous difficulty constructing your test suite, please feel free to consult the reference answers.

While you should create your own test suite to get the most out of this exercise, there are automated tests provided as well.

Example:

```
// Sample Input
var classList = ["Joe", "Jack", "John", "Fred", "Frank", "Barry", "Larry", "Mary",
"Harry", "Farrell", "Susan", "Monica", "Keira", "Caroline", "Harriet", "Erica",
"Luann", "Cheryl", "Beth", "Rupa", "Linda", "Allison", "Nancy", "Dora"];

// Sample Output
var classListWithAges = [{"name":"Joe","age":11},{"name":"Jack","age":10},
{"name":"John","age":11},{"name":"Fred","age":11},{"name":"Frank","age":11},
{"name":"Barry","age":11},{"name":"Larry","age":11},{"name":"Mary","age":11},
{"name":"Harry","age":11},{"name":"Farrell","age":10},{"name":"Susan","age":10},
{"name":"Monica","age":11},{"name":"Keira","age":10},{"name":"Caroline","age":10},
{"name":"Harriet","age":11},{"name":"Erica","age":11},{"name":"Luann","age":10},
{"name":"Cheryl","age":11},{"name":"Beth","age":10},{"name":"Rupa","age":11},
{"name":"Linda","age":10},{"name":"Allison","age":10},{"name":"Nancy","age":10},
{"name":"Dora","age":10}];

// FUNCTION DEFINITION(S)

// USE THIS FUNCTION TO GENERATE A RANDOM NUMBER
function getRandomIntInclusive(min, max) {
  min = Math.ceil(min);
  max = Math.floor(max);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}

function decorateClassListWithAges(classList) {
  // creates an object for each string in the input array, with an age of 10 or 11
  // returns an array of these objects
}

// ASSERTION FUNCTION(S) TO BE USED
function assertWithinRange(low, high, actual, testName){
    var inRange = low <= actual && high >= actual;
    if (inRange){
        console.log("passed");
    } else {
        console.log("FAIL");
    }
}
// TESTS CASES
var classList = ["Joe", "Jack", "John", "Fred", "Frank", "Barry", "Larry", "Mary",
"Harry", "Farrell", "Susan", "Monica", "Keira", "Caroline", "Harriet", "Erica",
"Luann", "Cheryl", "Beth", "Rupa", "Linda", "Allison", "Nancy", "Dora"];

```

### Tip

* Use a single quotation mark for a string

## Computer Science

**796. Ratate String**
We are given two strings, A and B.

A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some number of shifts on A.

Example 1:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
Output: false

Note:

A and B will have length at most 100.

**704. Binary Search**

Given a sorted (in ascending order) integer array nums of n elements and a target value, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index, otherwise return -1.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 
Note:

You may assume that all elements in nums are unique.
n will be in the range [1, 10000].
The value of each element in nums will be in the range [-9999, 9999].

**700. Search in a Binary Search Tree**

Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.

For example, 

Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2
You should return this subtree:

      2     
     / \   
    1   3
In the example above, if we want to search the value 5, since there is no node with value 5, we should return NULL.

Note that an empty tree is represented by NULL, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as [], not null.

**Isograms**

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Your task is to write and test a function that determines whether a string is an isogram, following the format of the previous problems. It should return true if the input string is an isogram, and should return false otherwise.

While you should create your own test suite to get the most out of this exercise, there are automated tests provided as well.

Notes:

Assume your input is only letters.
Assume the empty string is an isogram.
Ignore case.
Follow the pseudocode exactly!

```
// FUNCTION DEFINITION(S)
function isIsogram(text) {
  // add each char to a set
  // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set
  // note: a set drops dup values
  // thus, to see if all the chars were unique,
  // check length of text and the size of the set
}
```
