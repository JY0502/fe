**1. Two Sum**

Given an array of integers, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

* Answer

```Javascript
#!Javascript
function twoSum(nums, target) {
    const map = {};
    // index
    map[target - nums[0]] = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (map.hasOwnProperty(nums[i])) {
            return [map[nums[i]], i];
        }
        map[target - nums[i]] = i;
    }
}
```

**339. Nested List Weight Sum**

Given a nested list of integers, 
return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list 
-- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 10 
Explanation: Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1.

Example 2:

Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 27 
Explanation: One 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27.

**341. Flatten Nested List Iterator**
Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list 
-- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
Example 2:

Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].

**155. Min Stack**
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
Example:
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -3.
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();      --> Returns 0.
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -2.

**706. Design HashMap**
Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

To be specific, your design should include these functions:

put(key, value) : Insert a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. 
If the value already exists in the HashMap, update the value.
get(key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, 
or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
remove(key) : Remove the mapping for the value key 
if this map contains the mapping for the key.

Example:

MyHashMap hashMap = new MyHashMap();
hashMap.put(1, 1);
hashMap.put(2, 2);
hashMap.get(1);            // returns 1
hashMap.get(3);            // returns -1 (not found)
hashMap.put(2, 1);          // update the existing value
hashMap.get(2);            // returns 1 
hashMap.remove(2);          // remove the mapping for 2
hashMap.get(2);            // returns -1 (not found) 

Note:

All keys and values will be in the range of [0, 1000000].
The number of operations will be in the range of [1, 10000].
Please do not use the built-in HashMap library.

Don't use Map object.
