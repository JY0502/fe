* 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

* 339. Nested List Weight Sum

Given a nested list of integers, 
return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list 
-- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 10 
Explanation: Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1.

Example 2:

Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 27 
Explanation: One 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27.

* 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator
Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list 
-- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
Example 2:

Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].

* 155. Min Stack**
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
Example:
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -3.
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();      --> Returns 0.
minStack.getMin();   --> Returns -2.

* 706. Design HashMap
Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries.

To be specific, your design should include these functions:

put(key, value) : Insert a (key, value) pair into the HashMap. 
If the value already exists in the HashMap, update the value.
get(key): Returns the value to which the specified key is mapped, 
or -1 if this map contains no mapping for the key.
remove(key) : Remove the mapping for the value key 
if this map contains the mapping for the key.

Example:

MyHashMap hashMap = new MyHashMap();
hashMap.put(1, 1);
hashMap.put(2, 2);
hashMap.get(1);            // returns 1
hashMap.get(3);            // returns -1 (not found)
hashMap.put(2, 1);          // update the existing value
hashMap.get(2);            // returns 1 
hashMap.remove(2);          // remove the mapping for 2
hashMap.get(2);            // returns -1 (not found) 

Note:

All keys and values will be in the range of [0, 1000000].
The number of operations will be in the range of [1, 10000].
Please do not use the built-in HashMap library.

Don't use Map object.

* 796. Ratate String
We are given two strings, A and B.

A shift on A consists of taking string A and moving the leftmost character to the rightmost position. For example, if A = 'abcde', then it will be 'bcdea' after one shift on A. Return True if and only if A can become B after some number of shifts on A.

Example 1:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'cdeab'
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: A = 'abcde', B = 'abced'
Output: false

Note:

A and B will have length at most 100.

* 704. Binary Search

Given a sorted (in ascending order) integer array nums of n elements and a target value, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index, otherwise return -1.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
 
Note:

You may assume that all elements in nums are unique.
n will be in the range [1, 10000].
The value of each element in nums will be in the range [-9999, 9999].

* 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree

Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and a value. You need to find the node in the BST that the node's value equals the given value. Return the subtree rooted with that node. If such node doesn't exist, you should return NULL.

For example, 

Given the tree:
        4
       / \
      2   7
     / \
    1   3

And the value to search: 2
You should return this subtree:

      2     
     / \   
    1   3
In the example above, if we want to search the value 5, since there is no node with value 5, we should return NULL.

Note that an empty tree is represented by NULL, therefore you would see the expected output (serialized tree format) as [], not null.

* Isograms

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. Your task is to write and test a function that determines whether a string is an isogram, following the format of the previous problems. It should return true if the input string is an isogram, and should return false otherwise.

While you should create your own test suite to get the most out of this exercise, there are automated tests provided as well.

Notes:

Assume your input is only letters.
Assume the empty string is an isogram.
Ignore case.
Follow the pseudocode exactly!

```
// FUNCTION DEFINITION(S)
function isIsogram(text) {
  const letters = new Set([...text.toLowerCase()]);
  return text.length === letters.size;
}
```

* find first word with most repeated chars

```
function findMaxRepeatCountInWord(word) {
  const countMap = [...word].reduce((map, c) => map.set(c, map.has(c) ? map.get(c) + 1 : 1), new Map());
  return Math.max(...countMap.values());
}

function findFirstWordWithMostRepeatedChars(text) {
  const result = text.split(' ').reduce((res, word) => {
    const count = findMaxRepeatCountInWord(word);
    if (res.count < count) {
      res.word = word;
      res.count = count;
    }
    return res;
  }, { word: '', count: -1 });
  return result.word;
}

// ASSERTION FUNCTION(S) TO BE USED
function assertEqual(actual, expected, textName){
    if(actual === expected){
        console.log("passed");
    } else {
        console.log("FAILED");
    }
}
// TESTS CASES
var str = "Amerian banana yellow banana";
var actualWord = findFirstWordWithMostRepeatedChars(str);
var expectedWord = "banana";
console.log(actualWord, expectedWord, "display");
```

* Decorate Student List

Write a function called decorateClassListWithAges. Convert from an array, in this case a class list of names, to an array of object literals decorated with a name and an age for each student. Your decorateClassListWithAges function should use the provided getRandomIntInclusive as part of its solution. (The ages should be randomly generated for each student, either age 10 or age 11)

The "test suite" that you write for this question will be one of the most complex we have seen so far. In order to verify that your code works as expected, you will need to find a way to iterate over the actual array result of your function, then ensure that the age value for each object in your result is "within the range" of 10 to 11. If you are having tremendous difficulty constructing your test suite, please feel free to consult the reference answers.

While you should create your own test suite to get the most out of this exercise, there are automated tests provided as well.

Example:

```
// Sample Input
var classList = ["Joe", "Jack", "John", "Fred", "Frank", "Barry", "Larry", "Mary",
"Harry", "Farrell", "Susan", "Monica", "Keira", "Caroline", "Harriet", "Erica",
"Luann", "Cheryl", "Beth", "Rupa", "Linda", "Allison", "Nancy", "Dora"];

// Sample Output
var classListWithAges = [{"name":"Joe","age":11},{"name":"Jack","age":10},
{"name":"John","age":11},{"name":"Fred","age":11},{"name":"Frank","age":11},
{"name":"Barry","age":11},{"name":"Larry","age":11},{"name":"Mary","age":11},
{"name":"Harry","age":11},{"name":"Farrell","age":10},{"name":"Susan","age":10},
{"name":"Monica","age":11},{"name":"Keira","age":10},{"name":"Caroline","age":10},
{"name":"Harriet","age":11},{"name":"Erica","age":11},{"name":"Luann","age":10},
{"name":"Cheryl","age":11},{"name":"Beth","age":10},{"name":"Rupa","age":11},
{"name":"Linda","age":10},{"name":"Allison","age":10},{"name":"Nancy","age":10},
{"name":"Dora","age":10}];

// FUNCTION DEFINITION(S)

// USE THIS FUNCTION TO GENERATE A RANDOM NUMBER
function getRandomIntInclusive(min, max) {
  min = Math.ceil(min);
  max = Math.floor(max);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;
}

function decorateClassListWithAges(classList) {
  // creates an object for each string in the input array, with an age of 10 or 11
  // returns an array of these objects
  return classList.map(name => {
    return {
      name,
      age: getRandomIntInclusive(10, 11)
    };
  });
}

// ASSERTION FUNCTION(S) TO BE USED
function assertWithinRange(low, high, actual, testName){
    var inRange = low <= actual && high >= actual;
    if (inRange){
        console.log("passed");
    } else {
        console.log("FAIL");
    }
}
// TESTS CASES
var classList = ["Joe", "Jack", "John", "Fred", "Frank", "Barry", "Larry", "Mary",
"Harry", "Farrell", "Susan", "Monica", "Keira", "Caroline", "Harriet", "Erica",
"Luann", "Cheryl", "Beth", "Rupa", "Linda", "Allison", "Nancy", "Dora"];
