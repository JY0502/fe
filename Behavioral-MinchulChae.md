## Tell me about yourself

I am a senior front end and visualization engineer at Scoredata for one year and 8 months. 
Scoredata provides Machine learning platform. 
When I joined, the web application was not Single Page Application. 
So, I Migrated it to Responsive Single Page Application.
I developed core UI components, data analysis, model building and testing, also providing the prediction API for using user's own application. Also, the user can build their own visualizations and dashboards for data analysis and reporting it.

I have been a front end engineer for about 10 years and I was a full-stack engineer for 5 years.
