1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers, 
return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

339. Nested List Weight Sum

Given a nested list of integers, 
return the sum of all integers in the list weighted by their depth.

Each element is either an integer, or a list 
-- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 10 
Explanation: Four 1's at depth 2, one 2 at depth 1.

Example 2:

Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 27 
Explanation: One 1 at depth 1, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 3; 1 + 4*2 + 6*3 = 27.

341. Flatten Nested List Iterator
Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list 
-- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: [1,1,2,1,1]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].
Example 2:

Input: [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: [1,4,6]
Explanation: By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, 
             the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
